# Mersenne primes calculator

In this project are 3 files:

- [check_list.py](../master/check_list.py)
- [check_number.py](../master/check_number.py)
- [stop_when_found.py](../master/stop_when_found.py)

These all have the goal to find one or more mersenne prime numbers.

__check_list.py__ checks all of the numbers in a given list to be mersenne primes. (numbers are 2^n)

__check_number.py__ checks one to be mersenne primes. (number is 2^n)

__stop_when_found.py__ checks all of the numbers, starting from a given number, to be mersenne primes. The program stops when it has found a mersenne prime number. (numbers are 2^n)
